    <!-- AN DAGDA CONTENT -->
    <section class="container my-5">
        <p>An Dagda is one of the great gods of ancient Irish mythology—known as a protector, a leader, a creator, and a figure of immense strength.</p>
        <p>He was powerful, wise, playful, flawed, deeply human in his emotions, and capable of both great force and great compassion.</p>
        <p>Often called “The Good God”—not because he was perfect, but because he was good at everything he turned his hand to—An Dagda represents a fuller, more grounded idea of masculinity: strength woven with softness, courage balanced with heart, action guided by wisdom.</p>
        <p>But he was not without struggles, failures, or moments of uncertainty. And that’s what makes him important.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">A Symbol for Men Today</h3>
        <p>An Dagda’s story shows that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Power does not require hardness</li>
            <li>Strength can include vulnerability</li>
            <li>Wisdom is learned, not inherited</li>
            <li>And every man carries the ability to grow, shift, heal, and evolve</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He was not a fixed being, not trapped by one identity or one way of being. He changed, adapted, learned, and transformed throughout the old stories.</p>
        <p>In this way, An Dagda represents all of us. He reminds us that men are allowed to feel, to question, to release, to rebuild—on their own terms and in their own time.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Why This Matters for Breathwork & Men’s Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>Breathwork offers a space where men can reconnect with parts of themselves often pushed aside: quiet, emotion, intuition, fatigue, frustration, clarity, desire, purpose.</p>
        <p>It creates room for strength that isn’t forced—strength that rises from within.</p>
        <p>Like An Dagda, men today are invited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hold both power and openness</li>
            <li>Build resilience through awareness</li>
            <li>Release what no longer serves them</li>
            <li>Stand in themselves with honesty</li>
            <li>Return to simplicity and groundedness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Breathwork is not about fixing men—it’s about helping them come home to themselves, just as An Dagda returned again and again to his centre: his body, his breath, his truth.</p>
