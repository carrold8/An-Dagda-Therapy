    <!-- COURSE DESCRIPTION -->
    <section class="container my-5">
        <p>Relationships move through seasons — excitement, growth, pressure, uncertainty, joy, frustration, and everything in between. When life becomes overwhelming, communication tightens, emotions build, or stress pulls you in different directions, it’s easy to feel disconnected from the person you care about most.</p>
        <p>Couples breathwork sessions offer a grounded, supportive space for partners to come back to themselves and to each other. Through guided breathing, emotional awareness, and gentle connection work, you’ll learn how to regulate together, soften tension, and rebuild the sense of “us” beneath everything life is asking of you.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Why Breathwork for Couples?</h3>
        <p>Your breath is one of the most powerful tools you have — not just for your own regulation, but for how you show up in relationship. Breathwork can help couples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce stress, overwhelm, and emotional fatigue</li>
            <li>Improve communication by calming the nervous system</li>
            <li>Rebuild connection when life feels heavy or chaotic</li>
            <li>Release built-up frustration or emotional tension</li>
            <li>Feel more supported, seen, and understood</li>
            <li>Create space for softness, compassion, and presence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you breathe consciously together, your nervous systems begin to synchronise. You shift from reacting to relating. You meet one another from a place of grounded presence rather than pressure.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">A Space for Couples Facing Real-Life Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wedding planning and the emotional load it brings</li>
            <li>Mortgage applications, home building or moving</li>
            <li>Fertility challenges and the stress, hope, and heartbreak that can come with them</li>
            <li>Parenting pressures or preparing for family changes</li>
            <li>Busy lives that leave little space for connection</li>
            <li>Periods of emotional distance or miscommunication</li>
            <li>Times of increased stress, anxiety or uncertainty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Breathwork gives couples a way to slow down together, regulate together, and rebuild emotional safety — without needing perfect words or fixed solutions.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">What to Expect in a Session</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple grounding practices to regulate your nervous systems</li>
            <li>Guided breathwork to release tension and soften emotional blocks</li>
            <li>Connection-based breathing that helps partners feel attuned and present</li>
            <li>Silent shared breath to cultivate closeness without pressure</li>
            <li>Integration time to reflect, process, or simply rest together</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no expectation, no judgment, no “problem-solving.” Just space — held, calm, intentional — for you and your partner to reconnect.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Who These Sessions Are For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Want to feel closer and more connected</li>
            <li>Are navigating stress, change, or emotional heaviness</li>
            <li>Need a pause from pressure and external demands</li>
            <li>Want to explore a new way of deepening their relationship</li>
            <li>Prefer a gentle, body-based approach rather than talk-focused sessions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You do not need breathwork experience. Just a willingness to show up together.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Stay Updated or Book a Session</h3>
