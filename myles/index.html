        <p>Hi, I’m Myles, the practitioner behind An Dagda Therapy.</p>
        <p>My work is centred around one simple belief: <strong>your breath is your most powerful ally — physically, emotionally, and energetically.</strong></p>
        <p>My journey into breathwork began long before I realised it. Through personal growth, movement, and navigating life’s challenges, I kept returning to the same truth: when we reconnect with the breath, we reconnect with ourselves. Over time, that truth became not just a practice, but a calling.</p>
        <p>Today, I help people use breathwork to build strength, release tension, deepen awareness, and create meaningful shifts in both performance and wellbeing.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="section-title">My Approach</h2>
        <p>Breathwork isn’t a one-size-fits-all experience. My style blends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functional breathing for performance:</strong> Enhancing efficiency, endurance, focus, and recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Nervous system regulation:</strong> Building calm, resilience, and mental clarity—on and off the field.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep inner exploration:</strong> Guided breathwork that helps release stored emotions, open internal space, and reconnect you with a sense of presence and truth.</li>
            <li><strong>Energetic awareness:</strong> Supporting shifts in the subtle layers of the body through intuitive, rhythmic, and intention-led breathing practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My sessions are grounded, safe, and intentionally paced—offering both structure and freedom for you to explore your inner landscape.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="section-title">Who I Work With</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Athletes looking to improve performance or mental composure</li>
            <li>People seeking emotional release or deeper self-understanding</li>
            <li>Those wanting to reduce stress and reconnect with their body</li>
            <li>Anyone drawn to breathwork as a pathway to clarity and transformation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you’re just beginning or ready to deepen your practice, my role is to guide, support, and hold space for your journey.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="section-title">Why I Do This Work</h2>
        <p>Because I’ve seen how powerful it can be when someone learns to breathe with intention.</p>
        <p>Because I believe in the wisdom held in the body.</p>
        <p>Because I know real change doesn’t come from force—but from awareness, softness, and presence.</p>
        <p>And because helping people reconnect with themselves is the most meaningful work I know.</p>
