        <h2 class="section-title">Why Breathwork Matters for Athletes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boosted Efficiency & Endurance:</strong> Controlled, intentional breathing helps your body use oxygen more efficiently — feeding muscles, supporting endurance, and delaying fatigue.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Focus, Calm & Mental Clarity:</strong> Breathwork helps regulate your nervous system, reduce tension and anxiety, and sharpen focus. That calm readiness can be the difference between performance under pressure and reacting under stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Faster Recovery & Better Stress Response:</strong> Post-exercise breath practices can help lower heart rate and support recovery — giving your body and mind the rest they need to rebuild stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind–Body Integration & Resilience:</strong> Breathwork connects the physical and mental layers — helping you stay grounded, resilient, and in tune with your body under load.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because breathwork is simple, flexible, and requires no equipment, it's one of the most accessible ways to enhance performance — whether you're training, competing, or recovering.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">A Growing Trend in Elite Sport — You’re Not Alone</h2>
        <p>More and more teams recognise the value of breathwork. For example, before a match the Irish Rugby Team has been observed using breathing techniques as part of their pre-kick off routine — showing that breathwork is becoming a standard part of preparation, even at international level.</p>
        <p>That’s a powerful signal: breathwork isn’t just alternative wellness, it’s a performance tool used by world-class athletes.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="section-title">How Breathwork Fits Into Your Training</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick, powerful sessions to calm nerves and focus before competition</li>
            <li>Structured breathwork courses to build respiratory strength, control, and mental resilience</li>
            <li>Deep work for recovery, stress management, emotional release — helping you stay grounded on and off the field</li>
            <li>One-on-one sessions for personalised breath strategies aligned with your sport, training schedule, and goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you’re a runner, a team-sport athlete, a strength-trainer, or a weekend warrior — breathwork can become a key part of your training and wellbeing toolbox.</p>
